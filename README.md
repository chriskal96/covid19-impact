# Covid19 Impact on Global Flights

This repository includes an analysis of how Covid-19 pandemic has evolved over the year 2020 as well as if and how has affected air traffic.
For that purpose we build and designed a Data Warehouse based on a dataset of our choice.
Then build a data cube on top of it, develop OLAP reports and visualize our results. We used SQL Server Database, SQL Server Analysis Services and Power BI.

## Dataset

The dataset files are:
* [Covid19_Cases.xls](https://github.com/chriskal96/covid19-impact/blob/main/Covid19_Cases.xls)
* [covid_impact_on_airport_traffic.csv](https://github.com/chriskal96/covid19-impact/blob/main/covid_impact_on_airport_traffic.csv)
