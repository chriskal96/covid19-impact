# Covid19 Impact on Global Flights

This repository includes an analysis of how Covid-19 pandemic has evolved over the year 2020 as well as if and how has affected air traffic.
For that purpose we build and designed a Data Warehouse based on a dataset of our choice.
Then build a data cube on top of it, develop OLAP reports and visualize our results. We used SQL Server Database, SQL Server Analysis Services and Power BI.
